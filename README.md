# lolbuild
#### Learn What Top Challenger and Master players are Currently Building on your Champ!

## How to get started:
 * git clone this repo
 * Install Node.js
  * Go to https://nodejs.org/
  * Download and install
 * Run npm install 
 * Open a txt file and name it riotAPI.json
  * Format the file in this manner:
    { 
      "key": "YOUR API KEY"
    }
  * This should be saved in the cloned directory
 * On windows: set up a local webserver for the directory on localhost:3000
 * On Mac: run php -S localhost:3000
 * Open up a web browser and go to localhost:3000
 * You should see the app
 * You could also go to: lolbuilds.elasticbeanstalk.com 

## Why
 Building this app was fun. I've always wanted to know what top people are playing on my favorite champs and how their items look at the end of their games. This is a small insight into how they play differently than I do.

## Left to do:
 I didn't spend to much time on the app so there are bugs here and there that could be fixed. I was only able to work on it on my spare time. I hope everyone can use it to improve their game.
 * Animations for changing object
 * Loading animations with league sprites
 * Better side bar with search capabilities
 * More information that just builds (ie. Max Damage, total gold average ...)
